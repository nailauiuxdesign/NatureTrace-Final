# NatureTrace Dashboard Sound Integration

Complete solution for managing animal sounds in the NatureTrace dashboard with automatic fetching, batch updates, and user upload integration.

## üéØ Features

### ‚úÖ Automatic Sound Fetching for New Uploads
- **Enhanced Upload Flow**: When users upload animal images, sounds are automatically fetched and stored
- **Multiple Sources**: Searches Xeno-Canto, iNaturalist, Internet Archive, and other sources
- **Quality Filtering**: Prioritizes short (‚â§1s), high-quality research-grade sounds
- **Real-time Feedback**: Shows sound source and plays audio immediately after upload

### ‚úÖ Batch Sound Updates
- **Missing Sounds**: Automatically finds and updates all animals without sounds
- **Flexible Batching**: Process all animals or specify a limit
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress with detailed success/failure reporting
- **Source Analytics**: Breakdown of which sources provide the most sounds

### ‚úÖ Individual Animal Management
- **Single Updates**: Update sounds for specific animals by name or ID
- **Manual URLs**: Option to provide custom sound URLs
- **Source Tracking**: Records which source provided each sound
- **Update Timestamps**: Tracks when sounds were last updated

### ‚úÖ Dashboard Integration
- **Sound Management UI**: Built-in Streamlit interface for sound operations
- **Status Overview**: Real-time statistics on sound coverage
- **Quick Actions**: One-click sound updates for individual animals
- **Audio Preview**: Play sounds directly in the dashboard

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Test the Integration
```bash
python test_dashboard_integration.py
```
This runs comprehensive tests to verify everything is working.

### 2. Update All Missing Sounds
```bash
python batch_update_dashboard_sounds.py
```
Interactive script to update all animals missing sounds.

### 3. Use the Enhanced Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The dashboard now includes sound management features.

## üìÅ New Files Added

### Core Integration
- **`dashboard_sound_integration.py`**: Main integration class with all sound management functions
- **Enhanced `app.py`**: Updated upload flow with automatic sound fetching
- **Enhanced `utils/data_utils.py`**: New database functions for sound management

### Batch Operations
- **`batch_update_dashboard_sounds.py`**: Interactive script for bulk sound updates
- **`update_animal_sounds.py`**: Existing batch update script (enhanced)

### Testing & Verification
- **`test_dashboard_integration.py`**: Comprehensive test suite for all features
- **`test_sound_db_integration.py`**: Existing database integration tests

## üéµ How It Works

### For New User Uploads:
1. User uploads animal image(s)
2. Animal is identified using existing ML models
3. **NEW**: Sound is automatically fetched from multiple sources
4. Animal data + sound URL saved to database
5. User sees immediate feedback with audio preview

### For Existing Animals:
1. Dashboard shows current sound coverage statistics
2. Batch update can process all missing sounds
3. Individual animals can be updated on-demand
4. Sound sources and update times are tracked

### Sound Source Priority:
1. **Xeno-Canto**: Bird sounds, high quality, short duration preferred
2. **iNaturalist**: Research-grade observations with audio
3. **Internet Archive**: Filtered to avoid podcasts/lectures
4. **Hugging Face**: ML-generated or curated sounds

## üîß Configuration

### Database Schema
The system automatically adds these columns if they don't exist:
- `sound_url`: Direct URL to the audio file
- `sound_source`: Which service provided the sound
- `sound_updated`: Timestamp of last sound update

### Environment Setup
Ensure your `secrets.toml` has all required Snowflake credentials:
```toml
[snowflake]
snowflake_user = "your_user"
snowflake_password = "your_password"
snowflake_account = "your_account"
snowflake_warehouse = "your_warehouse"
snowflake_database = "your_database"
snowflake_schema = "your_schema"
snowflake_role = "your_role"
```

## üìä Usage Examples

### Dashboard Sound Management UI
The enhanced dashboard includes a "Sound Management" section with:
- **Sound Status Overview**: Coverage percentage, source breakdown
- **Batch Updates**: Update multiple animals with progress tracking
- **Individual Updates**: Target specific animals
- **Animals Without Sounds**: Quick list with one-click updates

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from dashboard_sound_integration import dashboard_sound_manager

# Add new animal with automatic sound
result = dashboard_sound_manager.add_animal_with_sound(
    filename="robin.jpg",
    name="American Robin",
    description="A migratory songbird",
    facts="Known for their melodic song",
    category="Bird",
    auto_fetch_sound=True
)

# Update existing animal sound
result = dashboard_sound_manager.update_existing_animal_sound("Robin")

# Batch update all missing sounds
result = dashboard_sound_manager.batch_update_all_missing_sounds(limit=10)

# Get dashboard statistics
status = dashboard_sound_manager.get_dashboard_sound_status()
print(f"Sound coverage: {status['sound_coverage_percentage']}%")
```

## üîç Monitoring & Analytics

### Sound Coverage Tracking
- Real-time percentage of animals with sounds
- Breakdown by sound source (Xeno-Canto, iNaturalist, etc.)
- Update history and timestamps
- Success/failure rates for batch operations

### Quality Metrics
- Average sound duration (shorter preferred for quick ID)
- Source reliability statistics
- User upload success rates
- Database query performance

## üé® User Experience Improvements

### Upload Flow Enhancements
- ‚úÖ **Auto-fetch sound checkbox**: User can choose whether to fetch sounds
- ‚úÖ **Real-time feedback**: Shows "Fetching sound..." spinner
- ‚úÖ **Immediate audio preview**: Plays sound right after upload
- ‚úÖ **Source attribution**: Shows which service provided the sound
- ‚úÖ **Graceful fallbacks**: Continues even if sound fetch fails

### Dashboard Enhancements
- ‚úÖ **Sound management section**: Dedicated UI for sound operations
- ‚úÖ **Progress indicators**: Visual feedback for batch operations
- ‚úÖ **Quick actions**: One-click buttons for common tasks
- ‚úÖ **Statistics display**: Real-time metrics and coverage
- ‚úÖ **Audio players**: Embedded players for each animal sound

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No sounds found"**
- Check internet connection
- Verify animal name spelling
- Try manual sound URL if specific source is needed

**"Database connection failed"**
- Verify Snowflake credentials in secrets.toml
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure role has proper permissions

**"Batch update slow"**
- Use smaller batch sizes (limit parameter)
- Check sound source availability
- Consider running during off-peak hours

### Getting Help
1. Run `test_dashboard_integration.py` for diagnostics
2. Check logs for detailed error messages
3. Verify database schema with existing tools
